## Overview

DM Hero helps Dungeon Masters organize their D&D campaigns by solving the problem of scattered information across multiple documents. Quickly find NPCs, locations, items, and track relationships between entities with powerful fuzzy search.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Universal Fuzzy Search** - Find entities even with typos using FTS5 + Levenshtein distance
- 🗺️ **Entity Management** - NPCs, Locations, Items, Factions, Quests, Sessions
- 🔗 **Relationship Tracking** - Link entities with typed relationships (e.g., "lives in", "works for")
- 📝 **Session Logs** - Track campaign timeline with entity mentions
- 🖼️ **Image Galleries** - Multiple images per entity with primary image selection
- 📄 **Markdown Documents** - Rich documentation with live preview
- 🎵 **Music Player** - Play your own music library at the table: folders become playlists, star them as scenes, crossfade, and a floating mini player that keeps playing while you navigate. Plus YouTube/Spotify/Tabletop Audio playlist links per session
- 🤖 **Optional AI Support (MCP)** - Optionally connect Claude, Cursor & co. to help fill a campaign from a module: entities with cross-links, portraits, documents, groups, maps, encounters and sessions — every change previewed first, never required
- 🗓️ **In-Game Calendar & Climate Zones** - Custom calendars, weather per region, session timeline
- 🌐 **Six Languages** - German, English, Italian, French, Spanish and Simplified Chinese
- 🎨 **Nine Themes** - From Midnight Tavern to Sunset Beat, each with its own living dashboard
